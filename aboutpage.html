    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <img src="about-photo3.png" class="about-main-image"/> <br/>
    <p>As an artist, I place equal amounts of emphasis on the visual and functional components of programming. Being a software developer is similar to being an artist in that it allows me to stretch my creative limits by building things and taking the time to make them beautiful. What I love about programming is that the things that I create help to solve people's problems and make their lives easier everyday. </p><br/>

    </div>
    
    <p> When I'm not programming, I love to bake, take photos, and travel. I'm always looking to add more cozy hobbies to my repertoire, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know! </p>
