# block11_personal_website_workshop
This repository contains HTML and CSS code for my personal website. The website consists of a homepage, an "about" page, a portfolio page, a contact page and a thank you page that pops up once the contact information form is submitted. The repository also holds .png images that are featured throughout the website, including screenshots of past projects and my own original photos. 

The vibe of my personal website is minimalist but fun! I have used a combination of advanced CSS selectors and rules (such as nth selectors and transitions) to create cool effects when you hover over the main header and the nav bar. 

I hope that you enjoy my work!
